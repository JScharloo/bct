<h1>Passions</h2>

    Self-improvement.  I think that by improving ourselves, we can effect change in others by sharing.
    It's not a new concept, but one I think everyone could do a better job of applying.  As part of my
    self-improvement, I have been studying the following:
</p>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Software Development:</strong> Languages, paradigms, concepts, tools, etc.  Most recently, in my spare time,
            I've been working on gaining a deeper understanding of <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>, as well
            as reviewing GUI (Graphical User Interface) programming.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Politics:</strong> Why do politicians make the decisions they make and what are the effects? How do various
            political systems and implementations differ? These are all interesting questions that are rarely
            answered by any country's media.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Economics:</strong> Countries are made and broken by these concepts, everybody should know how economies work
            and why they fail, in my opinion.  Lately I've been focusing on economic history in order to try to
            better understand income inequality in various regions as it is today.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Religion:</strong> I find religion to be a broad and fascinating subject.  While I do identify as an Atheist,
            I think that it is important to understand religion, the dogmas, and their effects throughout history.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Human Languages:</strong> Currently I am studying Norwegian (Bokm√•l), I also speak, read, and write Spanish.
            I think that by studying languages we can come to a deeper understanding of people as a whole.  the
            history of words and how they are used is a fascinating subject, it's also a great conversation
            starter.
        </li>
    </ul>
