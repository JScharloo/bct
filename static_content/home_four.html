<h1>Where I'm active</h1>

<p>
    Everybody has their favorite haunts, here are a few of mine:
</p>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong><a href="https://plus.google.com/+BrianTomlinson">Google Plus:</a></strong> Those who know me well
            know that the easiest place to get a hold of me is on Google Plus.  It is definitely my favorite place
            to engage with others.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            <strong><a href="https://github.com/darthlukan">GitHub:</a></strong> Chances are, if you haven't heard from
            me in a while, the answer to "What's Brian been up to?" can be found there.  I'm always working and GitHub
            is my service of choice for all things code.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            <strong><a href="http://ingress-cells.appspot.com/?q=NR03-HOTEL-13">Ingressing:</a></strong> While not nearly
            as active as most of the Rogaland Enlightened, I do a fair bit of smurf smashing and have been known to take up
            participation in some fairly brutal OPs.
        </li>
    </ul>
