<h1>Activities</h1>

<p>
    Supposedly this is the area where I'm supposed to talk about all of the awesome stuff I do
    outside of work, like go hiking, skydiving, or running in marathons.  If that's what you expected,
    well, I'm sorry to disappoint, but I'm not "that guy".

    I'm actually pretty "boring" to the "average" person.  Assuming most of the people I've met throughout
    my life could be considered "average", they're usually miffed by the fact that I tend to keep indoors.
    Sure, I can appreciate the outdoors and all, but I really do prefer to stay inside, huddled over my
    keyboard hacking away at various <a href="/html/projects">projects</a> and engaging with others on
    <a href="https://plus.google.com/+BrianTomlinson/posts">Google Plus</a>.

    All of that said, I'm not a total "homebody" and do manage to get outside every once in a while for a
    breath of fresh air.  Here's a video that proves I spend more than just my daily commute outside:
